- 👋 Hi, I’m Drew Riley @ScuubyDrew
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to creatively write in c++, java, and python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++ mainly for my programming courses at UCO. While I have introductions in java and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that can help broaden my knowledge of data structures and how to implement them
      in real world scenarios.
